# Porting Games From Other Systems To Atari

**Introduction**

The Atari 8-bit computers have astounding capabilities considering the chips were first manufactured for development systems in 1978 and the home computers went on sale to the public in 1979.  The computers are the evolutionary successor to the Atari 2600, and the ancestor of the Amiga.   Some Programming concepts from the 2600 apply to the Atari 8-bits, and understanding the Ataris provides insight into the Amiga's custom hardware features. 

The 2600 requires a programming methodology that would drive most people nuts.  The machine has 128 bytes of RAM.  (BYTES, not KILOBYTES.) There is no memory for graphics.  Everything displayed on the screen has to be written into the graphics chip's registers as the screen is drawn.  The game logic is slave to tight timing cycles.  Between the programming difficulty, and the more primitive graphics capabilities, Atari 2600 games tend to be simple.  In spite of this there are mind-blowing games on the 2600.  Respect is due the person who can write any kind of functional game for the 2600.

The Atari computers began design as the advanced replacement for the 2600 that would have more capabilities and be easier to program.  Almost as soon as design started the focus shifted to making a personal computer with advanced graphics ability.  Some of the resulting machines' graphics features would not be bested until the Amiga appeared.  

Programming the Atari computers is considerably easier than the 2600.  In fact, most of the time it allows downright lazy coding by comparison.  The graphics chips generate the playfield text and graphics and Player/Missile overlay graphics without direct CPU intervention.  The program simply arranges these things in memory and tells the graphics hardware where to find everything in memory.  An Atari computer game is free to spend more time on complex game logic. 

The Atari systems were popular, selling several millions of units, and around the 1982 to 1983 years they were very popular targets for software developers.  But, everything was not ported to all computers.  Every computer model had games written for them that may have been ported to only a limited number of systems that possibly did not include the Ataris, or may not have been ported to any other computer.

**Overview Of The Atari Hardware**

The first part of porting is knowing what you're porting to, and so understanding how to fit another computer's features into what the Atari can do.  Some things another computer can do may not be easily portable to the Atari, and at other times you may choose to enhance something on the Atari beyond what the original platform can do.

- 1.79 MHz 6502 processor.  This is one of the fastest 6502 computers released.  Most other systems worked at 1MHz.

- Custom character set.  The Atari's text modes can render the imagery for text characters from anywhere in memory.  The images for characters can be changed simply by pointing to different memory.

- 6 text modes.
  - 2 modes of 40 column text based on the "high resolution" pixels.  This allows monochrome text, plus a border color.  One mode is 8 scan lines tall which is the standard text display on the Atari.  The other is infrequently used and is 10 scan lines tall allowing for lower case descenders if an appropriate custom character set is supplied. 
  - 2 modes of 40 column text based on the "medium resolution" pixels. This allows up to 5 colors with 4 colors within a single character.
  - 2 modes of 20 column text based on the "medium resolution" pixels. This allows 5 colors.  Each character is a single color.

- 8 graphics modes.
  - color modes range from very low resolution at 40 pixels across the screen, to "medium resolution" at 160 pixels across the screen.  
  - "high resolution" mode is 320 pixels across the screen allowing monochrome graphics (2 shades of the same color)

- Mixing graphics modes on the screen.   The display is generated by the Graphics chip executing a "Display List" of instructions which specifies what kind of text or graphics to display on a horizontal line on the screen.

 - Display List Interrupt. The Display List instructions can trigger a machine language routine when the display reaches that line of the display.  Typical use is to change the value of color registers allowing more colors on screen, and changing the  Player/Missile graphics to new positions.

- Vertical Blank Interrupt. The end of the Display List at the bottom of the screen triggers a system machine language routine that can optionally transfer to a custom routine supplied by the program.
 
- Text/Graphics memory indirection.   Any part of the Atari computer's memory map may be displayed as text/graphics for each line in the Display List.  Memory used for text/graphics does not need to be contiguous from line to line. 

- Overscan.  The Atari display can extend vertically or horizontally beyond the edges of the typical TV.   (Mileage may vary on modern LCD screens or emulators.)  Vertical overscan is done with the Display List instructions.  Horizontal overscan is a register setting in the graphics chip.  Horizontal overscan means the chip is displaying more text characters or graphics pixels on the horizontal line than described earlier for normal graphics behavior.

- 128 color palette.  256 colors in some color interpretation modes.  Depending on graphics mode and color interpretation mode 2, 4, 5, 9, or 16 colors can be on screen at once without using any machine language routines to reuse colors.

- Color indirection.  In most of the display modes the normal color interpretation allows the colors on the screen to be any one of the 128 colors in the palette via a hardware register assigned to that color.  Changing the value of the color register changes all the pixels in the screen using that color register.

- Four color interpretation modes. The 14 text and graphics modes can be rendered using one of four kinds of color interpretation.  In theory, this makes 46 graphics modes possible.   However, the last three color interpretation modes work best in conjunction with certain graphics modes, so not all 46 combinations are practical.
  - Normal color interpretation. All the discussion above utilizing normal color indirection.
  - 16 shades of one base color.
  - Up to 9 colors using color indirection.
  - 16 colors all using the same brightness.

- Fine scrolling.
  - Up to 16 pixels horizontally (4 normal text characters) 
  - Up to 16 scan lines vertically.
  - Hardware assisted coarse scrolling.  The Display List can contain a pointer to the memory to use for graphics.    "Moving" a line of text or graphics means only updating  the pointer to memory instead of redrawing the entire line of data in memory. 

- Player/Missile graphics
  - Four, 8-pixel wide "Players" with separate color registers from  the text/graphics colors.
  - Four, 2-pixel wide "Missiles" using the Player's colors.
  - Full collision detection of Player/Missiles, and Playfield text/graphics to specific colors.
  - Variable priority allowing Player/Missiles to be in front or behind playfield text/graphics.
 
 - Four channel sound with variable noise waveforms.
 
 - Two (or four on the Atari 400/800) Joystick ports providing unique/separate input from the keyboard.
 
 - Option, Select, Start buttons read separately from the keyboard and joysticks.

Whew!  That's a lot, and it still leaves out considerable detail.  People have written entire books about this.

**Atari Programming Environments**

The next consideration for the Atari as the port target is understanding how the language you choose to work in affects the scope of what you can port to the Atari.  6502 Assembly language provides total control of the machine language program and offers complete use of all the Atari's features.  If it can be done on the Atari, it will be done in Assembly.

Atari BASIC -- It is easy to understand, and allows for fast code changes, and testing, since it is an interpreted language.  I use BASIC to prototype a program, so I can get logic in order and some semblance of the graphics working before starting in Assembly language.  If the game for the another computer is written in BASIC, then converting to Atari BASIC is the best practical first step.  However, operating in Atari BASIC limits the hardware features possible.  Some Atari graphics features require use of machine language.  If you are determined to work with BASIC, then I recommend using something other than Atari BASIC.  My favorite is OSS BASIC XL (or XE) which is compatible with Atari BASIC, but considerably faster, and has built-in support for Player/Missile graphics that Atari BASIC does not have.  However, no matter what you do, BASIC is far, far slower than Assembly language. 

There are versions of BASIC, and other languages that can be compiled into machine language.  Often the results are as good as having worked directly in Assembly, though sometimes there can still be compromises or language-specific gymnastics when working directly with Atari hardware features.  I do not have a lot of experience with these languages.  BASIC and Assembly cover all the bases for me.

THINGS YOU CAN DO IN ATARI BASIC

- Custom Character Set - It is easy to POKE data into memory to change the character images being used and then change the register value pointing to the character set images.

- Mixing any text and graphics modes on the same display. Building a Display List does not require Assembly language.

- Overscan.  Suprisingly easy, but not often used.  Build a Display List using more scan lines for vertical overscan.  Change the graphics chip's horizontal width register.   The change in display width does make it more difficult to print or plot graphics as the wide display does not match the expectations of the Operating System's graphics routines.

- Hardware assisted coarse scrolling.  Well-planned use of the Display List and pointers to screen memory can make coarse scrolling the display, or a limited set of lines on the display appear to move together as one solid object without tearing.

- Player/Missile graphics - Loading and positioning an image for Player/Missile graphics is easy in  BASIC.  Animating an image is a harder problem.  OSS BASIC XL has built-in commands for vertically moving Player missile graphics.  The other common method is to use Atari BASIC/BASIC XL's unique string capabilities to assign a string to Player/Missile memory and manipulate the string.

- Sound.  Atari BASIC includes commands to play sounds.  Complicated music would be more difficult just based on the execution speed.

**THE OTHER PLATFORMS**

Porting the First-person shooter Counter-Strike:Global Offensive to the Atari is a noble goal which you will probably never finish with acceptable results within your lifetime.  The best pool of potential games to port comes from other retro platforms at or below the capabilitities of the Atari.  A reasonable list is the common home computers released in the 1977 to 1983 timeframe: Pet, TRS-80, TRS color computer, Apple II, Vic-20, C64.  I'm not familiar with many non-US brands.  Based on YouTube review of games the BBC Micro should also be a potential source.

MOST of these platforms share similar limitations.  SOME are better than others.  Possible lowest common denominators:
- No graphics beyond a text display, or limited graphics.  
- If multiple graphics modes are possible the hardware cannot easily mix text and graphics modes on screen.  Where this does occur in games it is usually done by simply drawing text on a graphics display.
- Limited color palette:  2, 4, 8, or 16 colors.  Either no, or limited color indirection supported.
- Fine scrolling is usually not supported beyond physically redrawing the entire screen.
- Coarse scrolling requires redrawing the screen.
- No sound or limited sound.


PET

The Pet has no actual graphics capability and no color.  It does have a large text character set that with careful use can create displays that appear to be drawn graphics.  As everything is text-based any game object or moving player is based on character positions.
It has no sound, no joysticks, and as it has very limited hardware its BASIC language has little unique considerations.  There would be very little difference in capabilities between a BASIC program v an Assembly program other than the execution speed.  Games for the Pet 40xx series systems would fit well with in the Atari's capabilities.

TRS-80

TRS COLOR COMPUTER

BASIC PROGRAMS

BASIC programs will utilize fewer of the features of the computer making it easier to port to the Atari.


ASSEMBLY PROGRAMS

Assembly programs may use more features of the original platform.  Again, if the platform is less capable than the Atari then special considerations may need to be made.   Additionally, Oranges do not have to equal Apples, so an approximation or replacement in the Atari style could be done.

Port known games in Atari BASIC to Assembly and improve the gaming experience.
