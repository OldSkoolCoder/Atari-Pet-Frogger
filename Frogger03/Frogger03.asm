; ==========================================================================
; Version 00. November 2018
;
; As much of the Pet code is used as possible.
; In most places only the barest minimum of changes are made to deal with
; the differences on the Atari.  
;
; Notable changes:
; * References to fixed addresses are changed to meaningful labels.  This
;   includes page 0 variables, and score values.
; * Kernel call $FFD2 is replaced with "fputc" subroutine for Atari.
; * The Atari screen is a full screen editor, so cursor movement off the
;   right edge of the screen is different from the Pet requiring an extra
;   "DOWN" character to move the cursor to next lines.
; * Direct write to screen memory uses different internal code values, not
;   ASCII/ATASCII values.
; * Direct keyboard scanning is different requiring Atari to clear the
;   OS value in order to get the next character.  Also, key codes are
;   different on the Atari (and not the same as ASCII or Internal codes.)
; * Given the differences in clock speed and frame rates between the
;   UK Pet 4032 and the NTSC Atari the ported timing values have to be 
;   altered and the ultimate speed/rates are just guesswork.
;
; --------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Version 01.  December 2018
;
; Atari-specific optimizations, though limited.  Most of the program
; still could assemble on a Pet (with changes for values and registers).
; The only doubt I have is monitoring for the start of a frame where the
; Atari could monitor vcount or the jiffy counter.  Not sure how the Pet
; could do this.
;
; * No IOCB printing to screen.  All screen writing is directly to
;   screen memory.  This greatly speeds up the Title screen and game
;   playfield presentation.  It also shrinks that code a little.
; * New screens added when successfully crossing the river, dying, and
;   for game over.  The Huge text on these screens is constructed from
;   Atari-specific graphics/control characters.
; * Code is reorganized into an event/timer loop operation to modularize
;   game functions and facilitate future Atari-fication and other features.
;
; --------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Version 02.  February 2019
;
; The design principle continues to maintain the original presentation
; of a full screen of basic text.  (In Atari terms, this is ANTIC mode 2,
; or OS mode 0).  Everything else in the game is subject to Atari-fication.
;
; * Color.  Every line of the text mode has a DLI to set background color
;   and the foreground text luminance.  The color is also used as an
;   animation tool on the screens for dead frog, game over, and saving
;   a frog.
; * Joystick controller input.  Game controller input is a standard for
;   Atari games.  Say goodbye to the keyboard.
; * Sound.  Add at least simple sound effects for water/boats moving,
;   frog jumping, frog dying, rescuing a frog, joystick input.
; * Custom character set to make the frog look like a frog, and boats
;   look like plus other graphics enhancements.
; * Formalize game timing by implementing deferred vertical blank
;   interrupt to maintain the game activity and timings.
; * Screen memory is no longer declared at the same location as on the
;   Pet computer, and due to display lists is no longer contiguous RAM.
; * Display List LMS updates present the information on screen.
;   Displayed items can be presented by updating a few display list
;   LMS pointers rather than bulk movement of data through screen memory.
;   This is also used to move the boats around the screen by coarse
;   scrolling through the LMS.  This permits the screen memory to be
;   non-contiguous, and data can then be aligned in memory pages allowing
;   code to update either high byte or low byte of addresses.  Since the
;   frog is a character on screen it must move through screen memory
;   and so the game still requires six groups of beaches and boats
;   separately declared in memory.
;
; --------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Version 03.  August 2019
;
; The design principle is to continue to keep the play action as close as 
; possible to the original version as well as enhance the graphics 
; presentation as much as possible while still retaining layout as close 
; as possible to the original.  Changing features make the game appear 
; smoother, slicker looking.
;
; One play action difference -- in the original version the frog would 
; die when it contacted the left or right margin of the screen. In this 
; version the frog will not die (immediately).  When the frog reaches a 
; border it simply stops moving as the boats continue to leave the screen.
; Eventually, if the frog does not jump to a beach or the next safe place 
; on a boat, then the boat will slide out from under the frog and the frog
; will lose contact with the safe seat area.
;
; In spite of all the changes below which include making the boat lines
; taller with extra blank lines the screen manages to just barely fit
; the same number of beach and boat lines as the original.  This is due to
; the original version ignoring three full lines at the bottom of the 
; screen, and revising the credits to a single line of scrolling text.
; 
; * Horizontal fine scrolling the continuously scrolling credits line.
; * Halved the time for notes in Ode 2 Joy as it plays so long it 
;   starts to sound like a funeral dirge.
; * Horizontal fine scrolling the boats.
; * Manage Boat scrolling during the VBI.
; * Implement the frog as Player/Missile graphics.
; * Replace the chunky text "graphics" for Title, Saved, Game Over, and 
;   the Dead Frog with bitmaps for ANTIC map mode 9.  This is effectively 
;   the same pixel size, uses half the memory to cover the exact same
;   same screen real estate, and allows more color flexibility than 
;   Text mode 2.
; * Eliminate "blank" text lines where there is nothing displayed and use
;   actual blank line instructions in the Display List.   Additionally, 
;   the blank lines for the splash displays (Saved, Dead Frog, Game Over) 
;   can use smaller blank lines and so have more DLIs doing more color 
;   changes on the displays.
; * Revamp the DLI organization. Since each display has variations of 
;   screen content (especially the difference between Title, Game, and 
;   one of the "prize" screens) now each display has its own set of 
;   chained DLIs.  The VBI maintaining screens and DLI counter will also
;   enforce setting the base DLI routine for each display.

; ==========================================================================
; Random blabbering across the versions of Pet Frogger concerning
; differences between Atari and Pet, and the code considerations:
;
; Version 00 commentary. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
;
; It appears text printing on the Pet treats the screen like a typewriter.
; "Right" cursor movement the Pet uses to move through the full line
; width will cause the cursor to wrap around to the next line.  "Down" also
; moves to the next line.  I don't know for certain, but for printing
; purposes the program code makes it seem like character printing on the
; Pet does not support direct positioning of the cursor other than "Home".

; Printing for the Atari version is implemented similarly by sending single
; characters to the screen editor, E: device, channel 0.  The Atari's
; full screen editor does things differently.   Moving off the right edge
; of the screen returns the cursor to the left edge of the screen on the
; same line.  (Remember, full screen editor).  Therefore the Atari needs
; an extra "Down" cursor inserted where code expects the cursor on the
; Pet to be on the following line.  It also appears that replacing the
; "Right" cursor movements with a blank space should accomplish the same
; thing on the Atari, but for the sake of minimal changes Version 00 of the
; port retains the Pet's idea of cursor movement.

; Also, depending on how the text is printed the Atari editor can relate
; several adjacent physical lines as one logical line. Great for editing
; text lines longer than 40 characters, not so good when printing wraps the
; cursor from one line to the next.  Printing a character through the end of
; the screen line (aka the right margin) extends the current line as a
; logical line into the next screen line which pushes the content in the
; subsequent lines below further down the screen.

; Since some code does direct manipulation of the screen memory, I wonder
; why all the screen code didn't just do the same.  Copy from source to
; destination is easier (or at least more consistent) than printing.
; Changing all the text handling to use direct write is number one on
; the short list of Version 01 optimizations.

; The "BRK" instruction, byte value $00, is used as the end of string
; sentinel in the data.  This conflicts with the Atari character value
; $00 which is the graphics heart that the display uses in place of the
; "o" in "Dalesoft".  The end of string sentinel is changed to the Atari
; End Of Line character, $9B, which does not conflict with anything else
; in the code for printing or data.

; None of the game displays use the entire 25 lines available on the PET.
; The only time the game writes to the entire screen is when it fills the
; screen with the block graphics upon the frog's demise.  This conveniently
; leaves the 25th line free for the "ported by" credit.  But the Atari only
; displays 24 lines of text!?!  Gasp!  Not true.  The Atari can do up to
; 30 lines of text (240 scan lines).  Only the OS printing routines are
; limited to 24 lines of text.  The game's 25 line screen is accomplished
; on the Atari with a custom display list that also designates screen
; memory starting at $8000 which is the same location used by the Pet.
;
; --------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; Version 01 commentary. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
;
; "Printing" via standard OS I/O has been completely replaced by direct
; writes to screen memory.  This greatly speeds up the game screen
; and title screen presentation.
;
; Having entirely rewritten the game logic, the new modular nature
; made it easy to add new screens and to manage animated transitions
; between screens.  There are new splash screens with huge text built 
; of graphic control characters for when a frog dies, a frog is saved,
; and when the game is over.
;
; The high score is maintained in real-time with the player's score.
;
; The only thing that is really Atari-specific is monitoring the vertical
; blank.  Not sure how/if this could be done on the Pet.  The rest of the
; code is still pretty generic 6502 with screen memory at the Pet's
; standard location, $8000.  It should be easily portable back to the
; Pet by changing the character and key codes.
;
; Monitoring the vertical blank allows for more varied control of timing.
; The boat speeds are easily managed with a loop that relates the number
; of frogs saved to a frame count for delays.  Note that the code does
; not re-implement the CPU loop by waiting on frame updates.  Instead, it
; maintains counters during each frame and when counters reach 0 then the
; event (aka moving boats or accepting new input) is permitted.  This
; is effectively (cooperative) multitasking vaguely like an event loop.
;
; --------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; Version 02 commentary. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
;
; Adding color was essentially trivial.  A table-driven Display List
; Interrupt routine sets a new background color and text luminance value
; for each of the 25 text lines. A Vertical Blank interrupt enforces the
; DLI state to start at 0 for every frame.  A rough prototype showing
; colorized displays was added to Version 01 code in just a few hours.
;
; Now that there is a VBI running various other timing controls can be
; formally put into the VBI rather than using looping code that detects
; the start of a TV frame.
;
; Further use of the color indirection will eliminate the need to maintain
; and write normal text and inverse text in screen memory to make blinking
; text.  The game can simply update the colors for that line of text to
; make it appear to blink.
;
; Given the Atari's significant graphics indirection capabilities there is
; no need to draw a screen to present it.  The data to supply the graphics
; is already in memory.  Properly arranging the data will allow the Atari
; to display the data directly as screen data.  This eliminates the need
; to have separate data and screen memory, and also eliminates the need
; for the supporting code to copy the data to the screen.
;
; Aaaand, the Atari has more than one way to do this.  First, we could
; update the LMS addresses in the Display List to point to each line of
; data for screen memory.  Changing the screen (or just the screen
; contents) is reduced to writing a two-byte pointer for each line in the
; Display List instead of writing 40 bytes for each line to screen memory.
; And where there are blank lines or otherwise duplicate data the LMS can
; point to the same screen data for each line.
;
; The other way to do this is to have a separate Display List for each
; screen.  This reduces changing the screen to writing one address for
; the entire screen.
;
; We're mixing these two methods.  Each screen will have its own Display
; List with color tables.  Change the display list pointer and the entire
; screen changes.  The game screen will also use updates to the LMS
; for each moving boat line to coarse scroll the boat data without moving
; the boats in screen memory.
;
; Since the frog must move in screen memory, there still must be separate
; data for each line of boats and beaches.  In a future version when the
; frog is a Player/Missile object independent from screen data then it
; will be possible to reduce the boats to one line for left and one for
; right and re-use the data for each set of lines.
;
; --------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Version 03 commentary. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .
;
; Many Atarifications added in this go-round...
;
; The title screen has an animated frog done with player/missile graphics.
; This is the same player image (and same animation methods) as used for 
; the main game.
;
; Also, the title graphics are now actual graphics instead of characters.
; The graphics mode uses the same sized pixels as the 1/4 character-sized 
; squares in the graphics character version, but now requires only half 
; the memory used for the character version while providing real, 
; complete color control.
; 
; Some small changes were made to the directions/documentation text on the
; title screen.  Each line has different luminance for the text providing 
; a gradient-like effect.  
;
; The credits line now fine scrolls and is visible perpetually, giving the
; appears the program is always multi-tasking (which is not a completely 
; truthful implication.)
;
; A big change to the main and game screens are the score lines and 
; lives/saved frog information is present on both screens.  The 
; text labels are now independently colored, and so can be made to 
; do a strobe effect which is used during the attract mode on the title 
; screen and during the game when a value changes.  The text has the 
; appearance that the text labels are ANTIC Mode 4 text, but this is not
; so.  The text lines are still ANTIC Mode 2 text lines, because I wanted 
; the extra precision to continue using the frog head graphics to count
; saved frogs.   
;
; So, then how is the text colored?  They are Player/Missile graphics that
; provide (up to) 10 characters for each text line.  DLIs had to be 
; revised again to slice these up on screen.  DLIs provide colors and 
; reposition the Player/Missile graphics between score lines, and then 
; afterwards update the Player/Missile information again to provide the 
; animated shapes on the Title, Game, and Game Over screens.  In effect, 
; there are potentially 12 Players/12 Missiles hiding in plain sight on 
; screen (though not all are used all the time.)
;
; The VBI basically runs almost the entire game -- the boats' fine and 
; coarse scrolling, animating the boat images, animating score label 
; colors, moving the frog player (or other animated objects), playing the 
; sound sequences, and running the credits line fine scrolling.  Just 
; about everything moving occurs during the VBI.
;
; The main code handles the player's joystick input.  It determines the 
; next location for the frog (and other animated objects), but does not
; actually move anything,  The Main code initiates changing screen modes, 
; and running the event loops and changing event stages.  This includes 
; the color animations on the three splash screens.  From a 6502 code 
; perspective, almost nothing is going on per frame in the main code.  
; Most of the time the main code is just waiting for the frame counter to 
; change.
;
; The main code for the game loop is now restructured as a legitimate jump 
; table based on the current event target ID.  This cut out miles of code 
; of silly event ID checking and may give others the impression the 
; programmer is somehow clever. 
; 
; --------------------------------------------------------------------------

; ==========================================================================
; Ideas for Atari-specific version improvements, Version 01 and beyond!:
; * Remove all printing.  Replace with direct screen writes.  This will
;   be much faster. (IMPLEMENTED, V01)
; * Timing delay loops are imprecise.  Use the OS jiffy clock (frame
;   counter) to maintain timing, and while we're here make timing tables
;   for NTSC and PAL. (IMPLEMENTED, V01)  (PAL timing tables not 
;   actually in code, but discussed in the source.)  (V02 formalized this 
;   timing to using the Vertical Blank Interrupt service routine to 
;   manage activity frame by frame.)
; * Joystick controls.  I hate the keyboard.  The joystick is free and
;   easy on the Atari. (IMPLEMENTED, V02) 
; * Sound..  Some simple splats, plops, beeps, water sloshings.
;    (IMPLEMENTED, V02) 
; * Custom character set that looks more like beach, boats, water, and 
;   frog. (IMPLEMENTED, V02) 
; * Hardware coarse scrolling with LMS pointer updates rather than moving 
;   the boats in memory.  (IMPLEMENTED, V02) 
; * Improve boat, water, and beach visuals using multi-color, custom 
;   characters.  (IMPLEMENTED V03)
; * Horizontal Fine scrolling text to allow smoother movements for the 
;   boats. (IMPLEMENTED, V03) 
; * Player Missile Frog. This would make frog placement v the boat
;   positions easier when horizontal scrolling is in effect, not to 
;   mention extra color for the frog. (IMPLEMENTED, V03) 
; --------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Future Concepts:
; * Bigger boats (and fewer lines)?
; * Variable boat traffic?
; * Allow moving down.
; * Multi-player high scores, and saving to disk.
; * Simultaneous Two-Player mode?
; * Moving adversaries?
; --------------------------------------------------------------------------
; * Stir, rinse, repeat -- more extreme of all of the above: more color,
;   more DLI, more custom character sets, isometric perspective.
;   Game additions -- pursuing enemies, alternate boat shapes, lily pads,
;   bonus objects to collect, variable/changing boat speeds.  Heavy metal
;   chip tune soundtrack unrelated to frogs that has no good reason for
;   drowning out the game sound effects.  Boss battles.  Online multi-
;   player death matches.  Game Achievements.  In-game micro transaction
;   payments for upgrades and abilities.  Yeah, that's the ticket.

; 0   = Set by Main to direct VBI to stop managing sound pending an 
;       update from MAIN. This does not stop the POKEY's currently 
;       playing sound.  It is set by the VBI when a sequence is complete 
;       to indicate the channel is idle/unmanaged. 
; 1   = MAIN sets to direct VBI to start playing a new sound FX.
; 2   = VBI sets when it is playing to inform MAIN that it has taken 
;       direction and is now busy.
; 255 = Direct VBI to silence the channel immediately.
;
; So, the procedure for playing sound.
; 1) MAIN sets the channel's SOUND_CONTROL to 0.
; 2) MAIN sets the channel's SOUND_FX_LO/HI pointer to the sound effects 
;    sequence to play.
; 3) MAIN sets the channel's SOUND_CONTROL to 1 to tell VBI to start.
; 4) VBI sets the channel's SOUND_CONTROL value to 2 when playing, then 
;    when the sequence is complete, back to value 0.

; ======== D I S P L A Y   L I S T ======== EVILNESS
; Each display list (except the game screen) ends with a JMP to 
; here, BOTTOM_OF_DISPLAY.  These Display List instructions 
; provide the Press A Button prompt and the scrolling credit lines.
; The GAME screen jumps to the DL_SCROLLING_CREDIT location, 
; because it does not need the prompt.
;
; This laziness provides a constant, common DL section.  Only one 
; set of code is needed to manage the credit fine scrolling on 
; every Display.  If each Display List had its own instructions for 
; the credit line, then there would need to be more complicated 
; code using a lookup table to grab addresses for the credit line's 
; LMS based on the current display list in use.
; 
; Having one, common Display List code pointing to the scrolling text 
; also eliminates any possibility of the text glitching when switching 
; between displays.
