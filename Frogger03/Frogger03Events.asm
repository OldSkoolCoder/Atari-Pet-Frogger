; Frogger EVENTS
;
; All the routines to run for each screen/state.
; --------------------------------------------------------------------------

; Note that there is no mention in this code for scrolling the credits
; text.  This is entirely handled by the Vertical blank routine.  Every
; display list ends with common instructions that show the scrolling 
; credit text. The VBI routine updates the common Display List's LMS 
; pointer to the text.  Since the VBI is in control of this on all screens
; it means every display has continuous, seamless scrolling credit text 
; even when the display changes, and no matter what else is happening.

; Screen enumeration states for current processing condition.
; Note that the order here does not imply the only order of
; movement between screens/event activity.  The enumeration
; could be entirely random.

EVENT_INIT        = 0  ; One Time initialization.

EVENT_START       = 1  ; Entry Point for New Game setup.
EVENT_TITLE       = 2  ; Credits and Instructions.

EVENT_TRANS_WIN   = 5  ; Transition animation from Game to Win.
EVENT_WIN         = 6  ; Crossed the river!

EVENT_TRANS_DEAD  = 7  ; Transition animation from Game to Dead.
