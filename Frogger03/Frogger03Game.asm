; And the perpetual loop calling the game's event dispatch routine.
; The code needs this routine as a starting place, so that the 
; routines called from the subroutine table have a place to return
; to.  Otherwise the RTS from those routines would be at the 
; top level and exit the game.

; GAME LOOP
;
; The main event dispatch loop for the game... said Capt Obvious.
; Very vaguely like an event loop or state loop across the progressive
; game states which are (loosely) based on the current mode of
; the display.
;
; Each event sets CurrentEvent to change to another event target.
; --------------------------------------------------------------------------

GameLoop
	jsr libScreenWaitFrame     ; Wait for end of frame, start of new frame.

; Due to the frame sync above, at this point the code
; is running at/near the top of the screen refresh.

	lda CurrentEvent           ; Get the current event
	asl                        ; Times 2 for size of address
	tax                        ; Use as index

	lda EVENT_TARGET_TABLE+1,x ; Get routine high byte
	pha                        ; Push to stack
	lda EVENT_TARGET_TABLE,x   ; Get routine low byte 
	pha                        ; Push to stack

	rts                        ; Forces alling the address pushed on the stack.

	; When the called routine ends with rts, it will return to the place 
	; that called this routine which is up in GameStart.
