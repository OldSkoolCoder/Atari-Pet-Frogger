BLINK_SPEED      = 3  ; Speed of updated to Press A Button prompt.

TITLE_SPEED      = 2  ; Scrolling speed for title.

; Timer values.  NTSC.
; About 9-ish Inputs per second.
; After processing input (from the joystick) this is the number of frames
; to count before new input is accepted.  This prevents moving the frog at
; 60 fps and maybe compensates for any jitter/uneven toggling of the joystick
; bits by flaky controllers.
; At 9 events per second the frog moves horizontally 18 color clocks, max. 
INPUTSCAN_FRAMES = $07 ; previously $09

; Originally, this was coarse scroll movement and the frog moved the 
; width of a character.  
; Based on number of frogs, how many frames between the boats' 
; character-based coarse scroll movement:
; ANIMATION_FRAMES .byte 30,25,20,18,15,13,11,10,9,8,7,6,5,4,3
;
; Fine scroll increments 4 times to equal one character 
; movement per timer above. Frog movement is two color clocks,
; or half a character per horizontal movement.
;
; Minimum coarse scroll speed was 2 characters per second, or 8 
; color clocks per second, or between 7 and 8 frames per color clock.
; The fine scroll will start at 7 frames per color clock.
;
; Maximum coarse scroll speed (3 frames == 20 character movements 
; per second) was the equivalent of 4 color clocks in 3 frames.
; The fine scroll speed will max out at 3 color clockw per frame.
;
; The Starting speed is slower than the coarse scrolling version.
; It ramps up to maximum speed in fewer levels/rescued frogs, and 
; the maximum speed is faster than the fastest coarse scroll
; speed (60 FPS fine scroll is faaast.)

; FYI -- SCROLLING RANGE
; Boats Right ;   64
; Start Scroll position = LMS + 12 (decrement), HSCROL 0  (Increment)
; End   Scroll position = LMS + 0,              HSCROL 15
; Boats Left ; + 64 
; Start Scroll position = LMS + 0 (increment), HSCROL 15  (Decrement)
; End   Scroll position = LMS + 12,            HSCROL 0

; Difficulty Progression Enhancement.... Each row can have its own frame 
; counter and scroll distance. 
; (and by making rows closer to the bottom run faster it produces a 
; kind of parallax effect. almost).

MAX_FROG_SPEED = 13 ; Number of difficulty levels

; About the arrays below.  18 bytes per row instead of 19:
; FrogRow ranges from 0 to 18 which is 19 rows.  The first and
; last rows are always have values 0.  When reading a row from the array,
; the index will overshoot the end of a row (18th entry) and read the 
; beginning of the next row as the 19th entry.  Since both always 
; use values 0, they are logically overlapped.  Therefore, each array 
; row needs only 18 bytes instead of 19.  Only the last row needs 
; the trailing 19th 0 added.
; 14 difficulty levels is the max, because of 6502 indexing.
; 18 bytes per row * 14 levels is 252 bytes.
; More levels would require more pointer expression to reach each row
; rather than simply (BOAT_FRAMES),Y.
