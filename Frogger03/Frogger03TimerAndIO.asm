; "NA NA NA NA Right Left Down Up", 0 bit means joystick is pushed.
; Cook the bits to turn on the directions we care about and zero the other
; bits, therefore, if stick value is 0 then it means no input.
; - Down input is ignored (masked out).
; - Since up movement is the most likely to result in death the up movement
;    must be exclusively up.  If a horizontal movement is also on at the
;    same time then the up movement will be masked out.
;
; Arcade controllers with individual buttons would allow both left and
; right to be pressed at the same time.  To avoid unnecessary fiddling
; with the frog in this situation eliminate both motions if both are
; engaged.

; STRIG0 Button
; 0 is button pressed., !0 is not pressed.

; and trigger set are 1 bits.  Bit values:   00011101
