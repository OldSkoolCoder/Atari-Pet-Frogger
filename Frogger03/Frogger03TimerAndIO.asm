; Timer values.  NTSC.
; About 9-ish Inputs per second.
; After processing input (from the joystick) this is the number of frames
; to count before new input is accepted.  This prevents moving the frog at
; 60 fps and compensates for any jitter/uneven toggling of the joystick
; bits by flaky controllers.
; At 9 events per second the frog moves horizontally 18 color clocks, max.

;
; Fine scroll increments 4 times faster to equal one character 
; movement per timer above. 
;
; Minimum coarse scroll speed was 2 character per second, or 8 
; color clocks per second, or between 7 and 8 frames per color clock.
; The fine scroll will start at 10 frames per color clock.
;
; Maximum coarse scroll speed (3 frames == 20 character movements 
; per second) was the equivalent of 4 color clocks in 3 frames.
; The fine scroll speed will max out at 1 color clock per frame.
;
; The Starting speed is slower than the coarse scrolling version.
; It ramps up to maximum speed in fewer levels/rescued frogs, and 
; the maximum speed is slightly slower than the fastest coarse scroll
; speed (still, this is 60 FPS fine scroll which is faaast.)

; - Down input is ignored (masked out).
; - Since up movement is the most likely to result in death the up movement
;    must be exclusively up.  If a horizontal movement is also on at the
;    same time then the up movement will be masked out.
;
; Arcade controllers with individual buttons would allow both left and
