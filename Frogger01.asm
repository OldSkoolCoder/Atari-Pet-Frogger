; ==========================================================================
; Pet Frogger
; (c) November 1983 by John C. Dale, aka Dalesoft
; for the Commodore Pet 4032
;
; ==========================================================================
; Ported (parodied) to Atari 8-bit computers
; by Ken Jennings (if this were 1983, aka FTR Enterprises)
;
; Version 00, November 2018
; Version 01, December 2018
; --------------------------------------------------------------------------

; ==========================================================================
; Version 00.
; As much of the Pet code is used as possible.
; In most places only the barest minimum of changes are made to deal with
; the differences on the Atari.  Notable changes:
; * References to fixed addresses are changed to meaningful labels.  This
;   includes page 0 variables, and score values.
; * Kernel call $FFD2 is replaced with "fputc" subroutine for Atari.
; * The Atari screen is a full screen editor, so cursor movement off the
;   right edge of the screen is different from the Pet requiring an extra
;   "DOWN" character to move the cursor to next lines.
; * Direct write to screen memory uses different internal code values, not
;   ASCII/ATASCII values.
; * Direct keyboard scanning is different requiring Atari to clear the
;   OS value in order to get the next character.  Also, key codes are
;   different on the Atari (and not ASCII or Internal codes.)
; * Given the differences in clock speed and frame rates between the
;   UK Pet 4032 the game is intended for and the NTSC Atari to which it is
;   ported the timing values in the delays are altered to scale the game
;   speed more like the original on the Pet.
;
; --------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Version 01.  December 2018
; Atari-specific optimizations, though limited.  Most of the program
; still could assemble on a Pet (with changes for values and registers).
; The only doubt I have is monitoring for the start of a frame where the
; Atari could monitor vcount or the jiffy counter.  Not sure how the Pet
; could do this.
; * No IOCB printing to screen.  All screen writing is directly to
;   screen memory.  This greatly speeds up the Title screen and game
;   playfield presentation.  It also shrinks that code a little.
; * New screens added when successfully crossing the river, dying, and
;   for game over.  The Huge text on these screens is constructed from
;   Atari-specific graphics/control characters.
; * Code is reorganized into an event/timer loop operation to modularize
;   game functions and facilitate future Atari-fication and other features.

; ==========================================================================
; Random blabbering across the versions of Pet Frogger concerning
; differences between Atari and Pet, and the code considerations:
;
; Version 00 commentary. . . .
; It appears text printing on the Pet treats the screen like a typewriter.
; "Right" cursor movement used to move through full line width will cause
; the cursor to wrap around to the next line.  "Down" also moves to the next
; line.  I don't know for certain, but for printing purposes the program
; code makes it seem like character printing on the PET does not support
; direct positioning of the cursor other than "Home".

; Printing for the Atari version implemented similarly by sending single
; characters to the screen editor, E: device, channel 0.  The Atari'
; full screen editor does things differently.   Moving off the right edge
; of the screen returns the cursor to the left edge of the screen on the
; same line.  (Full screen editor, remember).  Therefore the Atari needs
; an extra "Down" cursor inserted where code expects the cursor on the
; Pet to be on the following line.  It looks like replacing the "Right"
; cursor movements with a blank space should accomplish the same thing,
; but for the sake of minimal changes Version 00 of the port retains the
; Pet's idea of cursor movement.

; Also, depending on how the text is printed the Atari editor can relate
; several adjacent physical lines as one logical line. Great for editing
; text lines longer than 40 characters, not so good when printing wraps the
; cursor from one line to the next.  Printing a character through the end of
; the screen line (aka the right margin) extends the current line as a
; logical line into the next screen line which pushes the content in lines
; below that further down the screen.

; Since some code does direct manipulation of the screen memory, I wonder
; why all the screen code didn't just do the same.  Copy from source to
; destination is easier (or at least more consistent) than printing.
; Changing all the text handling to use direct write is number one on
; the short list of Version 01 optimizations.

; The "BRK" instruction, byte value $00, is used as the end of string
; sentinel in the data.  This conflicts with the Atari character value
; $00 which is the graphics heart that the display uses in place of the
; "o" in "Dalesoft".  The end of string sentinel is changed to the Atari
; End Of Line character, $9B, which does not conflict with anything else
; in the code for printing or data.

; None of the game displays use the entire 25 lines available on the PET.
; The only time the game writes to the entire screen is when it fills the
; screen with the block graphics upon the frog's demise.  This conveniently
; leaves the 25th line free for the "ported by" credit.  But the Atari only
; displays 24 lines of text!?!  Gasp!  Not true.  The NTSC Atari can do up
; to 30 lines of text.  Only the OS printing routines are limited to 24
; lines of text.  The game's 25 screen lines is accomplished on the Atari
; with a custom display list that also designates screen memory starting at
; $8000 which is the same location the Pet uses for its display.
; --------------------------------------------------------------------------

; ==========================================================================
; Ideas for Atari-specific version improvements, Version 01 and beyond!:
; * Remove all printing.  Replace with direct screen writes.  This will
;   be much faster.
; * Timing delay loops are imprecise.  Use the OS jiffy clock (frame
;   counter) to maintain timing, and while we're here make timing tables
;   for NTSC and PAL.
; * Joystick controls.  I hate the keyboard.  The joystick is free and
;   easy on the Atari.
; * Color... Simple version: a DLI for each line could make separate text
;   line colors for beach lines vs boat lines (and credit text lines.)
; * Sound..  Some simple splats, plops, beeps, water sloshings.
; * Custom character set that looks more like beach, boats, water, and frog.
; * Horizontal Fine scrolling text allows smoother movements for the boats.
; * Player Missile Frog. This would make frog placement v the boat
;   positions easier when horizontal scrolling is in effect, not to mention
;   extra color for the frog.
; * Stir, rinse, repeat -- more extreme of all of the above: more color,
;   more DLI, more custom character sets, isometric perspective.
;   Game additions -- pursuing enemies, alternate boat shapes, lily pads,
;   bonus objects to collect, variable/changing boat speeds.  Heavy metal
;   chip tune soundtrack unrelated to frogs that has no good reason for
;   drowning out the game sound effects.  Boss battles.  Online multi-
;   player death matches.  Game Achievements.  In-game micro transaction
;   payments for upgrades and abilities.  Yeah, that's the ticket.
