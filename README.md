# Atari-Pet-Frogger

OldSkoolCoder presented a video on YouTube and source code on GitHub for a Frogger-like game written for the PET in 1983.

The PET assembly source is here:  https://github.com/OldSkoolCoder/PET-Frogger

This repository is for the Pet Frogger game ported to the Atari, and other subsequent versions with Atari-esque style enhancements to the game as I have time and interest.

The assembly code for the Atari depends on my MADS include library here: https://github.com/kenjennings/Atari-Mads-Includes.

As much of the Pet code is used as possible.  In most places only the barest minimum of changes are made to deal with the differences on the Atari.

More to come.
