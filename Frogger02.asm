; ==========================================================================
; Version 00.
; As much of the Pet code is used as possible.
; In most places only the barest minimum of changes are made to deal with
; the differences on the Atari.  Notable changes:
; * References to fixed addresses are changed to meaningful labels.  This
;   includes page 0 variables, and score values.
; * Kernel call $FFD2 is replaced with "fputc" subroutine for Atari.
; * The Atari screen is a full screen editor, so cursor movement off the
;   right edge of the screen is different from the Pet requiring an extra
;   "DOWN" character to move the cursor to next lines.
; * Direct write to screen memory uses different internal code values, not
;   ASCII/ATASCII values.
; * Direct keyboard scanning is different requiring Atari to clear the
;   OS value in order to get the next character.  Also, key codes are
;   different on the Atari (and not ASCII or Internal codes.)
; * Given the differences in clock speed and frame rates between the
;   UK Pet 4032 the game is intended for and the NTSC Atari to which it is
;   ported the timing values in the delays are altered to scale the game
;   speed more like the original on the Pet.
;
; --------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Version 01.  December 2018
; Atari-specific optimizations, though limited.  Most of the program
; still could assemble on a Pet (with changes for values and registers).
; The only doubt I have is monitoring for the start of a frame where the
; Atari could monitor vcount or the jiffy counter.  Not sure how the Pet
; could do this.
; * No IOCB printing to screen.  All screen writing is directly to
;   screen memory.  This greatly speeds up the Title screen and game
;   playfield presentation.  It also shrinks that code a little.
; * New screens added when successfully crossing the river, dying, and
;   for game over.  The Huge text on these screens is constructed from
;   Atari-specific graphics/control characters.
; * Code is reorganized into an event/timer loop operation to modularize
;   game functions and facilitate future Atari-fication and other features.
;
; --------------------------------------------------------------------------
; Version 02.  January 2019
; The design principle continues to maintain the original presentation 
; of a full screen of basic text.  (In Atari terms, this is ANTIC mode 2, 
; or OS mode 0).  Everything else in the game is subject to Atari-fication.
; * Color.  Every line of the text mode has a DLI to set background color
;   and the foreground text luminance.  The color is also used as an 
;   animation tool on the screens for dead frog, game over, and saving 
;   a frog.
; * Joystick controller input.  Game controller input is a standard for
;   Atari games.  Say goodbye to the keyboard.  
; * Sound.  Add at least simple sound effects for water/boats moving, 
;   frog jumping, frog dying, rescuing a frog, joystick input.
; * Custom character set to make the frog look like a frog, and boats 
;   look like plus other graphics enhancements.
; * Formalize game timing by implementing deferred vertical blank 
;   interrupt to maintain the game activity and timings.
; * Screen memory is no longer declared at the same location as on the 
;   Pet computer, and due to display lists is no longer contiguous RAM.
; * Display List LMS updates present the information on screen. 
;   Displayed items can be presented by updating a few display list 
;   LMS pointers rather than bulk movement of data through screen memory.
;   This is also used to move the boats around the screen by coarse 
;   scrolling through the LMS.  This permits the screen memory to be
;   non-contiguous, and data can then be aligned in memory pages allowing
;   code to update either high byte or low byte of addresses.  Since the 
;   frog is a character on screen it must move through screen memory 
;   and so the game still requires six groups of beaches and boats 
;   separately declared in memory.
;

; ==========================================================================
; Random blabbering across the versions of Pet Frogger concerning
; differences between Atari and Pet, and the code considerations:
;
; Version 00 commentary. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
; It appears text printing on the Pet treats the screen like a typewriter.
; "Right" cursor movement the Pet uses to move through the full line 
; width will cause the cursor to wrap around to the next line.  "Down" also
; moves to the next line.  I don't know for certain, but for printing 
; purposes the program code makes it seem like character printing on the 
; Pet does not support direct positioning of the cursor other than "Home".

; Printing for the Atari version is implemented similarly by sending single
; characters to the screen editor, E: device, channel 0.  The Atari's
; full screen editor does things differently.   Moving off the right edge
; of the screen returns the cursor to the left edge of the screen on the
; same line.  (Remember, full screen editor).  Therefore the Atari needs
; an extra "Down" cursor inserted where code expects the cursor on the
; Pet to be on the following line.  It also appears that replacing the 
; "Right" cursor movements with a blank space should accomplish the same 
; thing on the Atari, but for the sake of minimal changes Version 00 of the 
; port retains the Pet's idea of cursor movement.

; Also, depending on how the text is printed the Atari editor can relate
; several adjacent physical lines as one logical line. Great for editing
; text lines longer than 40 characters, not so good when printing wraps the
; cursor from one line to the next.  Printing a character through the end of
; the screen line (aka the right margin) extends the current line as a
; logical line into the next screen line which pushes the content in the 
; subsequent lines below further down the screen.

; Since some code does direct manipulation of the screen memory, I wonder
; why all the screen code didn't just do the same.  Copy from source to
; destination is easier (or at least more consistent) than printing.
; Changing all the text handling to use direct write is number one on
; the short list of Version 01 optimizations.

; The "BRK" instruction, byte value $00, is used as the end of string
; sentinel in the data.  This conflicts with the Atari character value
; $00 which is the graphics heart that the display uses in place of the
; "o" in "Dalesoft".  The end of string sentinel is changed to the Atari
; End Of Line character, $9B, which does not conflict with anything else
; in the code for printing or data.

; None of the game displays use the entire 25 lines available on the PET.
; The only time the game writes to the entire screen is when it fills the
; screen with the block graphics upon the frog's demise.  This conveniently
; leaves the 25th line free for the "ported by" credit.  But the Atari only
; displays 24 lines of text!?!  Gasp!  Not true.  The Atari can do up to
; 30 lines of text (240 scan lines).  Only the OS printing routines are 
; limited to 24 lines of text.  The game's 25 line screen is accomplished 
; on the Atari with a custom display list that also designates screen 
; memory starting at $8000 which is the same location used by the Pet.
;
; --------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; Version 01 commentary. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
; "Printing" via standard OS I/O has been completely replaced by direct
; writes to screen memory.  This greatly speeds up the game screen 
; and title screen presentation.
;
; Having entirely rewritten the game logic, the new modular nature 
; made it easy to add new screens and to manage animated transitions 
; between screens.  There are new screens with huge text built of 
; graphic control characters for when a frog dies, a frog is saved, 
; and when the game is over.
;
; The high score is maintained in real-time with the player's score.
; 
; The only thing that is really Atari-specific is monitoring the vertical
; blank.  Not sure how/if this could be done on the Pet.  The rest of the 
; code is still pretty generic 6502 with screen memory at the Pet's
; standard location, $8000.  It should be easily portable back to the 
; Pet by changing the character and key codes.
; 
; Monitoring the vertical blank allows for more varied control of timing. 
; The boat speeds are easily managed with a loop that relates the number 
; of frogs saved to a frame count for delays.  Note that the code does 
; not re-implement the CPU loop by waiting on frame updates.  Instead, it 
; maintains counters during each frame and when counters reach 0 then the 
; event (aka moving boats or accepting new input) is permitted.  This 
; is effectively (cooperative) multitasking vaguely like an event loop.
;
; --------------------------------------------------------------------------
;
; Version 02 commentary. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 
; Adding color was essentially trivial.  A table-driven Display List 
; Interrupt routine sets a new background color and text luminance value 
; for each of the 25 text lines. A Vertical Blank interrupt enforces the 
; DLI state to start at 0 for every frame.  A rough prototype showing 
; colorized displays was added to Version 01 code in just a few hours.
;
; Now that there is a VBI running various other timing controls can be 
; formally, put into the VBI rather than using looping code that detects 
; the start of a TV frame.
;
; Further use of the color indirection will eliminate the need to maintain
; and write normal text and inverse text in screen memory to make blinking 
; text.  The game can simply update the colors for that line of text to 
; make it appear to blink.
;
; Given the Atari's significant graphics indirection capabilities there is 
; no need to draw a screen to present it.  The data to supply the graphics 
; is already in memory.  Properly arranging the data will allow the Atari 
; to display the data directly as screen data.  This eliminates the need 
; to have separate data and screen memory, and also eliminates the need 
; for the supporting code to copy the data to the screen.
;
; Aaaand, the Atari has more than one way to do this.  First, we could 
; update the LMS addresses in the Display List to point to each line of 
; data for screen memory.  Changing the screen (or just the screen 
; contents) is reduced to writing a two-byte pointer for each line in the 
; Display List instead of writing 40 bytes for each line to screen memory. 
; And where there are blank lines or otherwise duplicate data the LMS can 
; point to the same screen data for each line. 
;
; The other way to do this is to have a separate Display List for each 
; screen.  This reduces changing the screen to writing one address for 
; the entire screen.  
;
; We're mixing these two methods.  Each screen will have its own Display 
; List with color tables.  Change the display list pointer and the entire 
; screen changes.  The game screen will also use updates to the the LMS 
; for each moving boat line to coarse scroll the boat data without moving 
; the boats in screen memory.
;
; Since the frog must move in screen memory, there still must be separate 
; data for each line of boats and beaches.  In a future version when the 
; frog is a Player/Missile object independent from screen data then it 
; will be possible to reduce the boats to one line for left and one for 
; right and re-use the data for each set of lines.
;
; --------------------------------------------------------------------------

; ==========================================================================
; Ideas for Atari-specific version improvements, Version 01 and beyond!:
; * Remove all printing.  Replace with direct screen writes.  This will
;   be much faster. (IMPLEMENTED, V01)
; * Timing delay loops are imprecise.  Use the OS jiffy clock (frame
;   counter) to maintain timing, and while we're here make timing tables
;   for NTSC and PAL. (IMPLEMENTED, V01)  (V02 formalized this to a real
;   Vertical Blank Interrupt service routine.)
; * Joystick controls.  I hate the keyboard.  The joystick is free and
;   easy on the Atari.
; * Color... Simple version: a DLI for each line could make separate text
;   line colors for beach lines vs boat lines (and credit text lines.)
; * Sound..  Some simple splats, plops, beeps, water sloshings.
; * Custom character set that looks more like beach, boats, water, and frog.
; * Horizontal Fine scrolling text allows smoother movements for the boats.
; * Player Missile Frog. This would make frog placement v the boat
;   positions easier when horizontal scrolling is in effect, not to mention
;   extra color for the frog.
; * Stir, rinse, repeat -- more extreme of all of the above: more color,
;   more DLI, more custom character sets, isometric perspective.
;   Game additions -- pursuing enemies, alternate boat shapes, lily pads,
;   bonus objects to collect, variable/changing boat speeds.  Heavy metal
;   chip tune soundtrack unrelated to frogs that has no good reason for
;   drowning out the game sound effects.  Boss battles.  Online multi-
;   player death matches.  Game Achievements.  In-game micro transaction
;   payments for upgrades and abilities.  Yeah, that's the ticket.
