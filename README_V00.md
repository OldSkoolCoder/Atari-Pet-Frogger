**Porting PET FROGGER for Atari**

[Frogger00.asm](https://github.com/kenjennings/Atari-Pet-Frogger/blob/master/Frogger00.asm "Frogger00.asm") Atari assembly source.

[Frogger00.xex](https://github.com/kenjennings/Atari-Pet-Frogger/blob/master/Frogger00.xex "Frogger00.xex") Atari executable program.

The assembly code for the Atari depends on my MADS include library here: https://github.com/kenjennings/Atari-Mads-Includes.

PET FROGGER for Commodore PET 4032

(c) November 1983 by John C. Dale, aka Dalesoft

Ported (parodied) to Atari 8-bit computers November 2018 by Ken Jennings (if this were 1983, aka FTR Enterprises)

As much of the PET 4032 code is used as possible. In most places only the barest minimum of changes are made to deal with the differences on the Atari.  Yes, there is no sound.

Notable changes:

- References to fixed addresses are changed to meaningful labels.  This includes page 0 variables, and score values.

- Kernel call $FFD2 is replaced with "fputc" subroutine for Atari.

- The Atari screen is a full screen editor, so cursor movement off the right edge of the screen is different from the Pet requiring an extra "DOWN" character to move the cursor to next lines.

- Direct write to screen memory does not use ASCII/ATASCII codes on the Atari.  Instead, internal character codes are used. 

- Direct keyboard scanning is a little different on the Atari.  The OS register for the key needs to be cleared to the no-key-pressed value ($FF) in order to recognize the next key press.   Also, the keyboard codes are different on the Atari (and they're not ASCII/ATASCII or Internal character set codes.)

I think I did something that broke the display of multiple frogs that successfully crossed over the rivers.  One is displayed.   But if more frogs cross, still only one is displayed.

I dialed down the game speed a bit in order to shoot the video and make sure my elderly reflexes could manage some successful runs.
