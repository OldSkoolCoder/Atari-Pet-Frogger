; ======== The world's most inept sound system. ========
;
; The world's cheapest sequencer. Play one sound value from a table at each 
; call. Assuming this is done synchronized to the frame it performs a sound 
; change every 16.6ms (approximately)  (at 60fps)
; 
; Sound control between main process and VBI to turn on/off/play sounds.
; 0   = Set by Main to direct stop managing sound pending an update from 
;       MAIN. This does not stop the POKEY's currently playing sound. 
;       It is set by the VBI to indicate the channel is idle. (unmanaged) 
; 1   = Main sets to direct VBI to start playing a sound FX.
; 2   = VBI sets when it is playing to inform Main that it has taken 
;       direction and is now busy.
; 255 = Direct VBI to silence the channel.
;
; So, the procedure for playing sound.
; 1) MAIN sets SOUND_CONTROL to 0.
; 2) MAIN sets SOUND_FX_LO/HI pointer to the sound effects 
;    sequence to play.
; 3) MAIN sets SOUND_CONTROL to 1 to tell VBI to start.
; 4) VBI when playing sets SOUND_CONTROL value to 2.

; byte 3, 0 == end+stop sound.

;       255 == end (do not stop sound).
;       Eventually some other magic to be determined goes here.
