; All the routines to run for each screen/state.
; --------------------------------------------------------------------------

; Note that there is no mention in this code for scrolling the credits
; text.  This is entirely handled by the Vertical blank routine.  Every
; display list is the same length and every Display List ends with an LMS
; pointing to the Credit text.  The VBI routine updates the current
; Display List's LMS pointer to the current scroll value.  Since the VBI
; also controls what display is current it always means whatever is on
; Display is guaranteed to have the correct scroll value.  It should seem
; like the credit text is independent of the rest of the display as it will
; update continuously no matter what else is happening.

; Screen enumeration states for current processing condition.
; Note that the order here does not imply the only order of
; movement between screens/event activity.  The enumeration
; could be entirely random.
